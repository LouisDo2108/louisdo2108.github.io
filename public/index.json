Deal primarily with the spatial dimensions of an image and kernel. Fig 1. Separating a 3x3 kernel spatially Fig 2.

Separating the Sobel kernel DRAWBACK: not all kernels can be “separated”.\nDepthwise Separable Convolutions Difference: work with kernels that cannot be “factored” into 2 smaller kernels. → More commonly used. Deal with not just spatial dim, but also depth dim. Splits a kernel into 2 separate kernels to do 2 convolutions: Depthwise Fig 4. Depthwise Convolution Pointwise Fig 5. Pointwise convolution Fig 6. Pointwise upscale convolution 12x12x3 — (5x5x3x256) →12x12x256, we can illustrate this new convolution as 12x12x3 — (5x5x1x1) — \u0026gt; (1x1x3x256) — \u0026gt;12x12x256 The main difference between Normal and Separable Convolutions: Normal: transforming the image n times. Separable: transforming once, then elongated to n channels. DRAWBACK: reduces the number of parameters in a convolution, if the network is already small, the network might end up failing to properly learn during training.
